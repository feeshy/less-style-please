> A minimalist Jekyll theme built for writers, poets, and thinkers who organize their work through an archival hierarchy and nested lists. It brings paper-like, distraction-free literature typography to the web, offering seamless, out-of-the-box support for optimized Chinese and Latin webfont pairing.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Information Architecture

* **Manual Outlines**: Declare your core hierarchy in `_data/menu.yml` for absolute control over category ordering.
* **Intelligent Sorting**: Posts sort dynamically by published and modificated dates; updating an article bumps it to the top.
* **Dynamic Archives**: Timeline archives aggregate posts published or updated within that specific period, tracing your thought trajectory.
* **Copyright Metadata**: Global and Front Matter license overrides with multilingual CC auto-localization.

### 2. Typography & Performance

* **Functional Hierarchy**: Maps unique font families to content blocks for clear visual indexing.
* **Dual-Branch Builds**
  * **Full**: Sub-sliced Chinese and Latin webfonts for instant multilingual typography.
  * **Lite**: Latin-only font optimization for a near-zero performance footprint.
* **Licensing Palette**: Auto‑rendered footer CC license combos with global & Front Matter overrides.
* **PWA Caching**: Tuned service worker caching for speed and reliable offline reading.
